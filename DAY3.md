#11. How does the `map` method work in JavaScript, and can you provide an example of when you might use it to manipulate an array of objects?

The map method in JavaScript is used to transform each element of an array according to a provided function and create a new array with the results. It is often used for iterating over arrays and applying a function to each element individually.

Code:


![11](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/100-Days-Of-Challenge/assets/112583410/25885319-ebe1-4eed-8869-62256c45216e)

#12. Explain the purpose of the `filter` method. Provide an example where you use `filter` to extract elements from an array based on a specific condition.


The filter method is used to create a new array containing only elements that satisfy a specific condition. It is commonly employed when you want to extract or retain elements from an array based on a specified criterion.

Code:

#13. Discuss the default behavior of the `sort` method for strings and numbers. How would you use a custom comparison function to sort an array of objects by a specific property?

The sort method in JavaScript is used to arrange the elements of an array either in ascending or descending order. By default, it sorts strings alphabetically and numbers numerically. You can provide a custom comparison function for more complex sorting, such as sorting objects based on a specific property.

Code:


![13](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/100-Days-Of-Challenge/assets/112583410/eae80fe2-8deb-45f0-b5b9-bbc59c09699e)

#14. Describe the purpose of the `reduce` method and provide an example where you use it to compute a single value from an array of numbers.

The reduce method is designed to accumulate values of an array into a single result. It takes a callback function that is applied to each element, updating an accumulator variable that carries the final result. It's often used for tasks like summing all numbers in an array.

Code:


![14](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/100-Days-Of-Challenge/assets/112583410/0c8bf8d3-723b-436c-87b3-c568398e24e1)

#15. How does the `find` method differ from `filter`? Give an example of a scenario where using `find` is more appropriate than `filter`.

The find method is used to locate the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function. Unlike filter, it returns only the first matching element and stops searching once it finds a match.

Code:


![15](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/100-Days-Of-Challenge/assets/112583410/83a4ca26-1e43-4187-a56d-4415293e67ea)

#16. Create a chain of array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.) to transform an array of strings into a single concatenated string with a specific condition.

Code:

#17. Explain the concept of callback functions in the context of array methods. Provide an example of using a callback function with the `map` method.

In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be executed after the completion of a specific task or event. In the context of array methods like map, filter, and forEach, callback functions are used to define the logic that should be applied to each element of the array during iteration.

Code:

#18. How would you handle potential errors when using array methods like `find` or `reduce`? Provide an example of error handling in such a scenario.

Code:


![18](https://github.com/RumesahKhalid/100-Days-Of-Challenge/assets/112583410/6aeac0e5-ca20-4ab0-ba07-a52037589332)

#19. Discuss the importance of immutability when working with array methods. Demonstrate how you would perform immutable operations using methods like `map` or `filter`.

Importance of Immutability:

Immutability is a concept where the state of an object (or data structure) cannot be modified after it is created. In the context of working with array methods in JavaScript, immutability is crucial for several reasons:

•	Predictability: Immutable data structures lead to more predictable and easier-to-understand code. Once an array is created, its contents remain constant, reducing unexpected side effects.

•	Debugging: Immutability simplifies debugging since you can trace the source of changes more easily. If an issue arises, you can focus on the specific part of the code where the change occurred.

•	Functional Programming: Immutability aligns with functional programming principles, making code more modular and enabling the use of pure functions, which have no side effects.

•	Concurrency: Immutable data structures are inherently thread-safe, facilitating concurrent programming without the risk of race conditions caused by shared mutable state.

#20. Compare the performance implications of using `map` versus `forEach`. In what scenarios would you prefer one over the other, and why?

Performance Implications of map versus forEach:

Both map and forEach are array iteration methods in JavaScript, but they differ in their purposes and return values, which can impact performance in certain scenarios.

map:

Purpose: Used for creating a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

Return Value: Returns a new array with the results of applying the provided function to each element.

Performance Consideration: map creates a new array, which might involve additional memory allocation. It's optimized for functional programming and is suitable when you want to transform each element and create a new array.

forEach:

Purpose: Used for iterating over each element of an array without creating a new array.

Return Value: undefined (forEach returns undefined).

Performance Consideration: forEach is generally faster than map because it doesn't create a new array. It is suitable when you need to perform an operation on each element of an array without generating a new array.
